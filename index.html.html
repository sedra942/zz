<h2>
    1-first gen 
</h2>
<p>First-generation fighter jets emerged right after World War II (late 1940s to mid-1950s) as the world transitioned from propeller-driven aircraft to jet-powered flight. These early jets were revolutionary but still carried over many features from piston-engine planes, like straight wings and manual controls. They had limited radar, basic weapon systems (usually machine guns or cannons), and were mainly used for air-to-air combat. Notable examples include the Messerschmitt Me 262 (Germany), Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star (USA), and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (USSR).

    <h2>2-Second-generation</h2>
    Second-generation fighter jets appeared in the mid-1950s to 1960s, building on lessons from the Korean War. These jets introduced swept wings for higher speeds, afterburners, early radar systems, and air-to-air missiles, moving beyond just guns. They were faster (often reaching supersonic speeds), more agile, and better equipped for high-altitude combat. These fighters also began to specialize—some were designed for interception, others for ground attack.

Notable examples include the F-104 Starfighter (USA), MiG-21 (USSR), and English Electric Lightning (UK).

<h2>
    3-Third-generation</h2>
<p>
    These jets introduced more advanced avionics, radar-guided missiles, and multirole capabilities. They were more maneuverable, could engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, and began to feature fly-by-wire systems. Dogfighting made a comeback during conflicts like Vietnam, showing the need for agility and versatility.

<h2>
    4-Fourth-generation</h2>
</h2><img src="img/wet.jpg" alt="Fourth Generation Fighter Jet">
<p>
    This generation focused on high maneuverability, advanced radar, beyond-visual-range missiles, and fly-by-wire controls. They also added electronic warfare systems, composite materials, and supercruise in some cases. Multirole versatility became a standard.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        (USA) F-15 Eagle

        (France) Dassault Mirage 2000
</ul>
<h2>
    4.5-Generation</h2>
</h2><img src="img/ooo.jpg" alt="4.5 Generation Fighter Jet">
<p>
    These are upgraded 4th-gen fighters with partial stealth, improved avionics, Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, network-centric warfare capabilities, and better sensor fusion. They’re meant to bridge the gap before full 5th-gen fighters.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        (USA) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet
    </li>
    <li>
        (Eurofighter) Typhoon
</ul>
<h2>
    5-Generation</h2>
</h2><img src="img/llll.jpg" alt="5th Generation Fighter Jet">
<p>These jets are defined by stealth, supercruise, advanced sensor fusion, full situational awareness, and networked data sharing. They dominate in both air superiority and strike roles, often designed from the start with low observability.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        (USA) F-22 Raptor
    </li>
    <li>
        (USA) F-35 Lightning II
        </li> 
        <li>
        (China) Chengdu J-20

<h2>
    6-Generation</h2>
</h2>
These future jets aim to go beyond current capabilities with AI integration, directed-energy weapons, optional manning, loyal wingman drones, hypersonic speeds, extreme stealth, and full battlefield connectivity. Most are still in development or prototype stages.

        What do you imagine 7th-generation fighter jets would be like? Would they even need pilots… or could they be fully autonomous war machines controlled by thought, satellite, or something else entirely?
